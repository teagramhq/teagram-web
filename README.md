## teagram-web
Telegram Web K is based on Webogram, patched and improved. Its source is hosted at [teagramhq/teagram-web](https://github.com/teagramhq/teagram-web). Available for everyone here: https://web.telegram.org/k/


### Developing
Install dependencies with:
```lang=bash
pnpm install
```
This will install all the needed dependencies.


#### Running web-server
Just run `pnpm start` to start the web server and the livereload task.
Open http://localhost:8080/ in your browser.


#### Running in production

Run `node build` to build the minimized production version of the app. Copy `public` folder contents to your web server.

#### Building a private MTProto artifact

Private artifacts are selected explicitly with these environment variables:

```bash
MTPROTO_TARGET_MODE=private
MTPROTO_PRIVATE_ENDPOINT=wss://mtproto.example.test:2443/apiws
MTPROTO_PRIVATE_RSA_PUBLIC_KEY_FILE=/path/to/public-key.pem
```

The endpoint must be a normalized `wss://` URL outside `telegram.org`. The key file must contain exactly one 2048-bit RSA public key with exponent 65537 in either `RSA PUBLIC KEY` (PKCS#1) or `PUBLIC KEY` (SPKI) PEM format. It must not contain private key material.

Build the artifact with the same Vite command used by the project, for example:

```bash
MTPROTO_TARGET_MODE=private \
MTPROTO_PRIVATE_ENDPOINT=wss://mtproto.example.test:2443/apiws \
MTPROTO_PRIVATE_RSA_PUBLIC_KEY_FILE=/path/to/public-key.pem \
pnpm exec vite build --outDir dist-private
```

The build fails closed when target validation or the production-bundle audit fails. The audit rejects Telegram MTProto hostnames and IPs, HTTP MTProto transports, Telegram or test RSA keys, and additional WSS targets. A successful private artifact contains a restrictive CSP and the `mtproto-target.json` sidecar with only `mode`, normalized `endpoint`, RSA `fingerprint`, `sourceCommit`, and the completed artifact `artifactDigest`. The digest excludes the sidecar itself. Verify an existing output with `MTPROTO_TARGET_MODE=private pnpm run check-bundle -- dist-private`; private mode fails if the sidecar is missing.

Do not edit the sidecar or swap endpoints and keys in an existing output. Build a new artifact with the desired three variables. Leaving these variables unset keeps the ordinary Telegram build unchanged and does not emit a private manifest.

The `Private MTProto Artifact Request` workflow is the data-only manual entry point. It accepts a target ref as input and records it without checking out code or installing dependencies. The trusted `Private MTProto Artifact Publication` workflow receives only successful requests from the reviewed `master` workflow, resolves `refs/heads/master` or an exact release tag listed with its reviewed commit in `ci/private-artifact-reviewed-release-refs.json`, and rejects every other ref before dependency installation. It snapshots the reviewed target attestation and public key before the build, checks out only the allowlisted commit, and re-verifies the downloaded bundle, sidecar digest, source commit, CSP, and snapshot in an isolated publisher before upload. Changing the workflow definition, target, public-key bytes, or source commit without passing the reviewed request and snapshot checks fails closed.

### Running in docker

#### Developing: 
* Install dependencies `docker-compose up tweb.dependencies`.
* Run develop container `docker-compose up tweb.develop `.
* Open http://localhost:8080/ in your browser. 

#### Production:
* Run `docker-compose up tweb.production -d` nginx image and container to serve the build
* Open http://localhost:80/ in your browser.

You can use `docker build -f ./.docker/Dockerfile_production -t {dockerhub-username}/{imageName}:{latest} .` to build your production ready image.

### Debugging
You are welcome in helping to minimize the impact of bugs. There are classes, binded to global context. Look through the code for certain one and just get it by its name in developer tools.
Source maps are included in production build for your convenience.

#### Additional query parameters
* **test=1**: to use test DCs
* **debug=1**: to enable additional logging
* **noSharedWorker=1**: to disable Shared Worker, can be useful for debugging
* **http=1**: to force the use of HTTPS transport when connecting to Telegram servers

Should be applied like that: http://localhost:8080/?test=1

#### Taking local storage snapshots
You can also take and load snapshots of the local storage and indexed DB using the `./snapshot-server` [mini-app](/snapshot-server/README.md). Check the `README.md` under this folder for more details.

#### Preview all icons
You can see all the available svg icons by calling the `showIconLibrary()` global function in the browser's console.

### Troubleshooting & Suggesting

If you find an issue with this app or wish something to be added, let Telegram know using the [Suggestions Platform](https://bugs.telegram.org/c/4002).
